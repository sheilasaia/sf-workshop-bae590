# sf-workshop-bae590
This README file is associated with the 'Exploring Spatial Data with sf' workshop on February 7, 2019 for BAE 590 (Spring 2019).

# Workshop Data Set Download
You'll need to download and unzip the workshop data before coming to class. You can find the data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dGJhnoX_KVWBXHJqWzSIrCFr29iy916g?usp=sharing). If you know how to and have time to download this GitHub repo before coming to class, please move the spatial_data and tabular_data directories into the workshop_data directory associated with this GitHub repo. If you don't know how to do this, I'll walk through it at the start of class.

# Check R and RStudio Versions
You will need to make sure that you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your computer. Please see the R website [here](http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/) and the RStudio website [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) to download the latest versions. Please do this before coming to class.

# Update R Packages
Please make sure that all of your R packages are up-to-date. To do this open up RStudio and go to Tools > "Check for Package Updates..." and it will provide a list of package updates that are available. Please install these updates before coming to class.

# Survey
You will get a link for the pre-class and post-class surveys. Please fill these out so I know what you're background knowledge is and what you learned during the workshop.
